## 1. Static portfolio card
Discovered well designed portfolio cards that I tried to recreate  

## 2. Digital business card
Very similar project to the previous one. However, the design is more advance with some dynamic elements 

## 3. Personal travel page
Designed a personal travel page, that uses more elaborate design techniques.

## 4. AirBnB experience clone
The purpose of this project was to further develop my React skills. Therefore I discovered a well designed AirBnB-travel-experience blog that I tried to recreate. Added some elements that I didnt use before, such as using props in components.

## 5. Meme-generator
Found an free API that can be used to add meme-text to the random pictures fetched from the API. In this project I could use several Hooks introduced in React 16.8 functional components. These were useState and useEffect hooks. 

## 6. React-Facts (Dark/Light mode) 
Another project that uses fetch API to display data, this time random React Facts, that were displayed on cards. Added the dark and light mode design that can be switched between.

## 7. Notes-App
Created dynamic app that takes notes and saves them in local storage using NanoId and React Split NPM packages, first one serves to generate unique string IDs that are used for maping the data. React Split creates an instance that wrapps around children components and all additional props are passed through to the <div> component.
  
## 8. Tenzies Game
To switch a bit in the projects, I created Tenzies game that was suggested by Scrimba. This is a dice game that uses 10 dices, where a player rolls the dices and decides for which number he will go. He rolls as many times needed to have all the dices showing the same number. The game was created using React Hooks with NanoId npm package.
